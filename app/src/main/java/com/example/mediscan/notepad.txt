Extract the following details from the prescription in a structured JSON format:
Medicine name
Dose
Frequency (how many times per day)
Duration (how many days)
Times (when the medicine should be taken)
Food instructions (before or after food)
Rules for frequency, times, and food instructions:
If "every X hours" is mentioned, calculate the number of doses per day based on a 24-hour period, subtracting 10 hours for sleep. Distribute the doses evenly throughout the waking hours.

Example: "Take 1 tablet every 6 hours for 5 days after food."
{
  "medicine_name": "Paracetamol",
  "dose": "500mg",
  "frequency": "3 times per day",
  "duration": "5 days",
  "times": ["08:00 AM", "02:00 PM", "08:00 PM"],
  "food_instruction": "after food"
}
If "bedtime" is mentioned, the medicine is taken once at 09:00 PM.

Example: "Take at bedtime for 5 days before food."
{
  "medicine_name": "Paracetamol",
  "dose": "500mg",
  "frequency": "once at bedtime",
  "duration": "5 days",
  "times": ["09:00 PM"],
  "food_instruction": "after food"
}
If the frequency is given in "1-0-1" format (morning-noon-night):

"1" means the medicine should be taken, and "0" means it should be skipped.
Example: "1-0-1 for 7 days, after food."
{
  "medicine_name": "Amoxicillin",
  "dose": "250mg",
  "frequency": "2 times per day",
  "duration": "7 days",
  "times": ["08:00 AM", "08:00 PM"],
  "food_instruction": "after food"
}
If no frequency is specified, assume 3 times per day at 08:00 AM, 02:00 PM, and 08:00 PM.

Example: "Take for 5 days before food."
{
  "medicine_name": "Ibuprofen",
  "dose": "400mg",
  "frequency": "3 times per day",
  "duration": "5 days",
  "times": ["08:00 AM", "02:00 PM", "08:00 PM"],
  "food_instruction": "before food"
}
